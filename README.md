# ToDo App
Another todo app built in JavaScript you say? Sure why not! This is built using a class structure in vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark complete, and view their completed items.

## Getting Started
This is a very simple build, and not much is required. Simply run the ```index.html``` file in your browser.
